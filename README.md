# js-rich-body-highlighter

A premium, framework-agnostic muscle map. Instead of flat polygon fills (the
look every other body-highlighter library ships), it highlights muscles with
`mix-blend-mode` over a **detailed body illustration**. The red settles into the
grooves between muscle bundles, so each muscle looks lit from within and three
dimensional rather than painted flat. That richer look is the whole point.

- **Framework-agnostic core** in plain TypeScript, zero runtime dependencies.
- **Tiny React wrapper** at `js-rich-body-highlighter/react` (React is an
  optional peer dependency, so non-React users never pull it in).
- **Data-driven**: highlight muscles by id + intensity.
- **Adaptive size** for free: image and masks share one SVG `viewBox`, so sizing
  the `<svg>` scales everything together.

> Status: early. Ships 8 bundled bodies (male/female × front/back × light/dark,
> ~0.66 MB total as WebP) and one front-view mask (`pectoralis_right`). Masks are
> added one at a time via the playground.

## Install

```sh
npm install js-rich-body-highlighter
```

## Usage — core (any framework / vanilla)

```ts
import { MuscleMap } from 'js-rich-body-highlighter';

const map = new MuscleMap(document.querySelector('#app')!, {
  view: 'front',
  highlights: [{ id: 'pectoralis_right', intensity: 70 }],
  onMuscleClick: (id) => console.log(id),
});

map.update({ highlights: [{ id: 'pectoralis_right', intensity: 40 }] });
map.destroy();
```

## Usage — React

```tsx
import { MuscleMap } from 'js-rich-body-highlighter/react';

<MuscleMap
  view="front"
  highlights={[{ id: 'pectoralis_right', intensity: 70 }]}
  onMuscleClick={(id) => console.log(id)}
/>;
```

## How highlighting works

- The body is a raster image placed at `(0,0)` inside an `<svg>`.
- Each muscle is a `<path>` traced over that image, filled with the highlight
  color and blended with `mix-blend-mode: multiply`. Intensity is the path's
  opacity (0–100 → 0–1).
- The `<svg>` is `isolation: isolate`, so the blend only affects the body image,
  not the page behind it.

### Coordinate system

- Bodies are 2:3 portrait (shipped at 1365×2048). Pixel resolution does not matter
  for masks: the `<image>` is scaled to fill the viewBox, masks live in the viewBox.
- SVG `viewBox` (mm @ 96 DPI for a 2048×3072 canvas): `0 0 541.87 812.80`, so
  `PX2MM = 25.4 / 96 ≈ 0.264583`.
- Masks are authored in this viewBox, in Inkscape, over the **exact** body image
  version used by the package. A different image scale will not line up.
- Per-mask `offset` (in source pixels) becomes a `translate(dx dy)` in viewBox
  units (`px * PX2MM`), so it stays correct at any render size.

## Adding a muscle

1. Trace the muscle in Inkscape over the body image, export Optimized SVG.
2. Add one entry to `src/data/muscles/front.ts` (or `back.ts`):

   ```ts
   {
     id: 'biceps_left',
     name: 'Biceps brachii (left)',
     group: 'arms',
     gender: 'male',
     side: 'left',
     view: 'front',
     d: 'm... z',
   }
   ```

3. Run the playground, pick the matching gender + view, check the fit, nudge with
   arrow keys, copy the `offset`.

Masks are filtered by `gender` + `view` (`getMuscles(gender, view)`); male and
female anatomy differ, so each needs its own masks. The `theme` only swaps the
body image, so light/dark share the same masks.

`id` uses the anatomical side (the depicted person's side): on the front view,
the body's right muscle is on the **left** of the screen.

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm run dev               # playground at http://localhost:5173
npm run dev:demo          # showcase/preview (deployed to Vercel)
npm run build             # build dist/ (core + react) with tsup
npm run typecheck
npm run convert:bodies    # re-export assets-src/*.png -> src/assets/bodies/*.webp
```

### Playground

- Slider for highlight intensity (0–100).
- Arrow keys move the selected mask 1px (`Shift` = 10px) and show the
  ready-to-paste `offset` / `translate(...)`.
- Muscle list to pick and verify each mask.
